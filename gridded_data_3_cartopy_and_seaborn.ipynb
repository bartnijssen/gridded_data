    "**Abstract:** Climate change, forecasting, satellite datasets, large model ensembles ... Large gridded datasets are everywhere in hydrology and earth science. While accessing and analyzing these datasets required some serious programming skills not so long ago, a number of toolkits are now available that let you easily access, ingest, analyze and display gridded climate datasets. In this webinar weâ€™ll discuss one of the most common file formats used in our field for large data sets, the Network Common Data Format (NetCDF), and step through a Jupyter notebook to showcase python packages, such as xarray and cartopy, that can be used to examine them. No prior experience required, although we will build on some of the skills you have acquired in earlier webinars in the series."
